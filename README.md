#About the Program:
A Motion Detection program, that uses computer vision to detect and track movement in realtime.
There are 4 different frames: The Main Frame is what actually detects movement and subsequently highlights contours over the moving object. Text stating 'Motion Detected' aswell as the date and time is also displayed on the mainframe, when motion is detected.
The others are there to help the main frame spot movement. Delta Frame creates a background with the first frame and compares it with the current frame. Threshold Keeps everything black and white, this is so colours don't interfere with the program. Greyscale Frame adds a greyscale. 

#How to use:
The program is very simple to use. Just run it, and when you went to close the program, simply enter: 'q'
